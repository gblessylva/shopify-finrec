# ðŸš€ Render Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Render

Your Shopify Financial Dashboard is ready for deployment! Follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with your code (âœ… Already done!)
- Render account ([sign up here](https://render.com))
- Your Shopify Admin API credentials

### 2. Deploy via Render Dashboard

#### Option A: One-Click Deploy (Recommended)
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `shopify-to-sheets`
4. Render will auto-detect the `render.yaml` file

#### Option B: Manual Configuration
If auto-detection doesn't work:
- **Runtime**: Node
- **Build Command**: `npm run render:build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Auto Deploy**: Yes (deploys on git push)

### 3. Environment Variables
Set these in Render Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ Environment:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=your-shop-name.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_shopify_admin_api_token
PORT=10000
```

### 4. Get Your Shopify Credentials

#### For Private Apps (Recommended):
1. Shopify Admin â†’ Settings â†’ Apps and sales channels
2. "Develop apps" â†’ "Create an app"
3. Configure Admin API access scopes:
   - `read_orders`
   - `read_products` (if needed)
4. Install the app and copy the Admin API access token

#### For Custom Apps:
1. Shopify Partners â†’ Apps â†’ Create app
2. Set up Admin API permissions
3. Generate access credentials

### 5. Deployment Process
1. **Push to GitHub** (if you haven't):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Render Dashboard**:
   - Service will build automatically
   - Build takes ~3-5 minutes
   - Watch logs for any issues

### 6. Verify Deployment
Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app.onrender.com` - Dashboard UI
- `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/orders` - API endpoint
- `https://your-app.onrender.com/health` - Health check

### 7. Custom Domain (Optional)
- Render Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ Settings
- Add your custom domain
- Update DNS records as instructed

## ðŸ›  Build Process Details

The deployment automatically:
1. Installs root dependencies (`concurrently`)
2. Installs server dependencies (`express`, `cors`, etc.)
3. Installs client dependencies (`react`, `vite`, `tailwind`)
4. Builds the React client for production
5. Serves built client files from Express server

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify your Shopify credentials work locally first
- Check Render build logs for specific errors

### App Loads but No Data
- Verify `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL` format: `your-shop.myshopify.com`
- Check `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` has correct permissions
- Test API endpoint directly: `/api/orders`

### Performance Issues
- Render Starter plan has resource limits
- Consider upgrading to Professional plan for production
- Implement caching for frequent API calls

## ðŸ“Š Production Features

Your deployed dashboard includes:
- âœ… Real-time Shopify order data
- âœ… Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- âœ… CSV export functionality
- âœ… Pagination & filtering
- âœ… Column visibility controls
- âœ… Professional Shopify-style UI

## ðŸ’¡ Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Set up monitoring/alerts in Render
2. Configure regular backups if storing data
3. Set up custom domain
4. Add SSL certificate (automatic with Render)
5. Consider adding authentication for sensitive data
